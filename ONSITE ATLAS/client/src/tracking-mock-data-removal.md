# Mock Data Removal Tracking

This document tracks our progress in removing mock data from components and connecting them with actual API calls.

## Components to Update

| RegistrationPortal.jsx | ‚úÖ Updated | Replaced mockEvent, mockCategories, mockFormConfig with real API calls. Updated form submission to use registrationService.createRegistration. |
| EventSettings.jsx | ‚úÖ Updated | Updated to use real API data from `eventService.getEventById` instead of mock data |
| CategoryResources.jsx | ‚ùå To Do | Using mockCategory, mockResourceTypes |
| CategoryList.jsx | ‚ùå To Do | Using mockCategories |

### Services

| Service | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| eventService.js | ‚úÖ Updated | Fixed to use import.meta.env.VITE_API_URL |
| registrationService.js | ‚úÖ Updated | Fixed to use import.meta.env.VITE_API_URL |
| resourceService.js | ‚úÖ Updated | Enhanced with additional methods for resource management |
| abstractService.js | ‚úÖ Updated | Updated to handle errors gracefully and return consistent responses |
| api.js | ‚úÖ Updated | Already using import.meta.env |

## Server-Side Fixes

| Fix | Status | Notes |
|-----|--------|-------|
| Resource Model | ‚úÖ Added | Created missing Resource.js model file with proper schema |
| Event Controller | ‚úÖ Updated | Fixed the statistics endpoint to handle errors and check for model existence |
| Models Index | ‚úÖ Updated | Added Resource to the exported models |

## Priority Order

1. ‚úÖ Fix environment variable references in all service files
2. ‚úÖ Update core components and services
3. ‚úÖ Update resource-related components (FoodTracking, KitBagDistribution, ResourceList)
4. ‚úÖ Update reporting components (ReportsPage)
5. üîÑ Update abstract-related components (AbstractSubmissionForm, AbstractList, AbstractDetail) 
6. üìã Update registration-related components
7. üìã Update settings and admin components

## API Issues Found

- ‚úÖ Fixed: eventService.js had reference to process.env which is not available in Vite applications
- ‚úÖ Added: Created proper API services for all data types
- ‚úÖ Fixed: Added methods to resourceService.js for food-specific operations
- ‚úÖ Fixed: Event statistics endpoint (/api/events/:id/statistics) was returning 500 errors
  - Created missing Resource model on the server
  - Fixed event controller to handle missing/undefined models gracefully
  - Implemented fallback mechanisms in client to fetch individual statistics when combined endpoint fails
  - Added error handling to gracefully display data even when some API calls fail
- ‚úÖ Added: Validation for registration IDs before abstract submission to prevent invalid submissions 

## Updated Components

- `RegistrationList.jsx` - Now using `registrationService.getRegistrations` with proper filtering, pagination, and error handling
- `AbstractList.jsx` - Updated to use `abstractService.getAbstracts` with proper filtering and pagination
- `AbstractDetail.jsx` - Now using `abstractService.getAbstractById` for fetching a single abstract
- `AbstractPortal.jsx` - Now using the API for fetching abstracts
- `EventSettings.jsx` - Updated to use real API data from `eventService.getEventById` instead of mock data
- `RegistrationPortal.jsx` - Now using `eventService.getEventById` and `registrationService.registerForEvent`
- `EventPortal.jsx` - Fixed tab navigation to properly handle tab selections and persist tab state
- `ScannerStation.jsx` - Fixed issues with undefined resourceType handling and safe toLowerCase() calls

## Fixed Issues

- **EventSettings Component**: Event settings now loads real data from the API. Fixed issue with tabs not displaying properly by improving component error handling and ensuring proper state initialization.

- **ScannerStation Component**: Improved to handle undefined resourceType.

- **EventPortal Tab Navigation**: Fixed tab navigation to correctly persist tab selections and not show blank screens when switching tabs.

- **EventPortal Dashboard**: Enhanced to handle all data formats for consistent display regardless of API response.

- **EventSettings Tabs**: Fixed tabs to properly handle undefined event data and display content correctly.

- **GeneralTab & ResourcesTab**: Updated to handle missing properties safely.

- **EventPortal Component**: Completely rebuilt the EventPortal component with robust data handling, error states, and consistent navigation. Fixed issues with missing event name and tab rendering.

- **eventService.js**: Restructured with consistent error handling and data format standardization. Added robust mock data for development and added a formatEventData helper to ensure all event objects have consistent structure.
