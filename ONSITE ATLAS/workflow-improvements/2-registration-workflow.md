# Enhanced Registration Workflow

## Current Issues
- Complex componentized registration without clear guidance
- Package deals and discounts not seamlessly integrated
- Accompanying persons management limited
- Registration lookup bypass security concerns

## Proposed Enhancements

### 1. Guided Registration Wizard
```javascript
// client/src/components/registration/RegistrationWizard.jsx
const RegistrationWizard = () => {
  const steps = [
    'Personal Information',
    'Event Selection',
    'Package & Pricing',
    'Accompanying Persons',
    'Payment',
    'Confirmation'
  ];
  
  // Step-by-step validation
  // Progress indicator
  // Back/forward navigation with state preservation
  // Dynamic pricing calculation
};
```

### 2. Package Deal Integration
- Visual package comparison table
- Dynamic discount application
- Bundle recommendations based on selections
- Clear pricing breakdown at each step

### 3. Accompanying Persons Enhanced Flow
```javascript
// Enhanced accompanying person management
const AccompanyingPersonsManager = () => {
  // Add/remove accompanying persons dynamically
  // Individual meal preferences
  // Separate contact information
  // Fee calculations per person
  // Bulk operations for families/groups
};
```

### 4. Security Improvements
- Remove middleware bypass for registration lookup
- Implement proper token-based registration access
- Add rate limiting for registration attempts
- Enhanced validation for all registration steps

### 5. Real-time Features
- Live availability checking for workshops/sessions
- Dynamic pricing updates
- Instant validation feedback
- Progress saving and resume capability

### 6. Mobile Optimization
