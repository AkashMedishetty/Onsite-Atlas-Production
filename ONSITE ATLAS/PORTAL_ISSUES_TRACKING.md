**SUMMARY: COMPLETE SYSTEM RECONSTRUCTION REQUIRED**

The Resources tab represents the worst case of architectural debt in the entire system. The user's assessment of "something fundamentally wrong" and "too many issues" is completely accurate. This component requires immediate complete reconstruction, not incremental fixes.

**Immediate Actions Required:**
1. **STOP ALL WORK** on this component until architectural reconstruction
2. **Decompose immediately** into separate components 
3. **Rebuild each sub-system** with proper architecture
4. **Implement proper testing** for each component
5. **Mobile-optimize** all resource management interfaces

This represents the largest technical debt in the system and requires dedicated sprint focus for complete reconstruction.

3. **Dynamic Placeholder System** with validation and insertion
4. **Backend Integration** for WhatsApp and SMS configuration
5. **Test Messaging** functionality for both channels

**Phase 2 - Communication-Specific Features:**
1. **Bulk Messaging Interface** with recipient selection
2. **Attachment Support** for media and documents
3. **Message Analytics** dashboard for delivery tracking
4. **Trigger Automation** system for event-based messaging
5. **Advanced WhatsApp Features** (interactive messages, buttons)

**Phase 3 - Professional Communication Platform:**

#### **🚨 IMMEDIATE INTEGRATION REQUIRED:**

**Current State:** Complete theme system exists but settings interface cannot access it
**Required Action:** Replace static interface with ThemeContext integration
**Priority:** CRITICAL - Functioning theme system completely inaccessible

**Phase 1 - Critical ThemeContext Integration:**
1. **Replace static inputs** with ThemeContext-connected controls
2. **Integrate backend API** for theme persistence and loading
3. **Enable real-time preview** using existing applyThemeToDOM function
4. **Implement save/reset** functionality using existing context methods
5. **Connect registrant portal** theme synchronization

**Phase 2 - Professional Theme Designer:**
1. **Advanced color management** with palettes and accessibility tools
2. **Brand asset integration** for logos and imagery
3. **Theme templates** and customization library
4. **Comprehensive preview** with actual interface components
5. **Export/import functionality** for theme reuse
